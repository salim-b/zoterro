[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free tool for collecting, organizing, and citing research developed by [Corporation for Digital Scholarship](https://digitalscholar.org/). Zoterro (with double "r") is a simple R client to Zotero web API (ver. 3) with which you can access the data associated with your account or groups you are a member of.

See [Zotero API documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start) for what is available.


## Installation

Install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mbojan/zoterro) with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mbojan/zoterro")
```





## Examples

- Fetch a complete collection hierarchy as a data frame. By default it will fetch for the default user, but here we fetch the collections associated with a public Zotero group "Computational Social Science" that has an ID `269768`:
    ```{r ex-collections}
    collections(user = zotero_group_id(269768))
    ```
  Collections are identifed with unique `key`s. If any of the collections would be nested within some other collection, the key of the parent collection would appear in the column `parent`.

- Fetch all items from a collection. By default the format returned is a JSON parsed to a list:
    ```{r ex-collection-items-json}
    items <- collection_items(key="PJHH85S9", user = zotero_group_id(269768))
    str(items[[1]])
    ```
  The output format can be changed to e.g. BibTeX:
    ```{r ex-collection-items-bibtex}
        items_bibtex <- collection_items(
          key="PJHH85S9", 
          user = zotero_group_id(269768), 
          query = list(format="bibtex")
        )
        # This will print all the entries...
        # cat(rawToChar(items_bibtex))
        
        # ... but to save space we show just the first three:
        entries <- head(strsplit(
          rawToChar(items_bibtex), 
          "\n\n"
        )[[1]], 3 )
        cat(entries, sep="\n\n")
    ```
  

- Fetch all items from a collection and save to BibTeX file `references.bib`. Basically a conveniece wrapper for the example above.
    ```{r ex-save-collection, eval=FALSE}
    save_collection(
      key="PJHH85S9", 
      path = "references.bib",
      user = zotero_group_id(269768)
    )
    ```

- `zotero_api()` is a low-level function. It will make multiple requests if the results do not fit a single response. The following will fetch all items in the "My Publications" collection of the default user:
    ```{r ex-zotero-api, eval=FALSE}
    zotero_api(path="publications/items")
    ```
