[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free tool for collecting, organizing, and citing research developed by the [Corporation for Digital Scholarship](https://digitalscholar.org/). Zoterro (with double "r") is a simple R client to the [Zotero web API (ver. 3)](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start) which can be used to access the data of public groups, your personal account, or groups you are a member of.

The client implements convenience functions for fetching data from the most frequently needed API endpoints. Endpoints for which no convenience wrapper is offered (yet) can be accessed using the low-level interface provided by `zotero_api()`. See [Zotero API documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/basics) for what endpoints are available.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mbojan/zoterro) via:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mbojan/zoterro")
```

## Examples

-   Fetch a complete collection hierarchy as a data frame. The function defaults to the configured user ID determined by `zotero_usr()`, but here we fetch the collections associated with a public Zotero group ["Computational Social Science"](https://www.zotero.org/groups/269768/computational_social_science) that has the ID `269768`:

    ```{r ex-collections}
    collections(user = zotero_group_id(269768))
    ```

    Collections are identifed with unique `key`s. If any of the collections would be nested within some other collection, the key of the parent collection would appear in the column `parent`.

-   Fetch all items from a collection. By default the data is returned as a tibble:

    ```{r ex-collection-items-json}
    items(collection_key = "PJHH85S9", user = zotero_group_id(269768))
    ```

    The output format can be changed to e.g. BibTeX:

    ```{r ex-collection-items-bibtex}
        items_bibtex <- items(
          collection_key = "PJHH85S9",
          as_tibble = FALSE,
          user = zotero_group_id(269768),
          query = list(format = "bibtex")
        )
        # This will print all the entries...
        # cat(rawToChar(items_bibtex))
        
        # ... but to save space we show just the first three:
        entries <- head(strsplit(
          rawToChar(items_bibtex),
          "\n\n"
        )[[1]], 3 )
        cat(entries, sep = "\n\n")
    ```

-   Fetch all items from a collection and save to BibTeX file `references.bib`. Basically a conveniece wrapper for the example above.

    ```{r ex-save-collection, eval=FALSE}
    write_bib(
      collection_key = "PJHH85S9",
      path = "references.bib",
      user = zotero_group_id(269768)
    )
    ```

-   `zotero_api()` is a low-level function. It will make multiple requests if the results do not fit in a single response. The following will fetch all items in the "My Publications" collection of the default user:

    ```{r ex-zotero-api, eval=FALSE}
    zotero_api(path = "publications/items")
    ```
